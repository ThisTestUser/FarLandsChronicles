Before we start using mods, there are actually a couple of Far Lands-related phenomena that can be observed in a completely vanilla install of 1.12.2 simply via the use of customized worlds.

Firstly, it's quite easy to encounter the Overworld's sky Far Lands (discussed in further detail in part 2) simply by setting the heightScale of a Customized world to a sufficiently high value. The lowest such value that generates sky Far Lands is 69273664. If heightScale is set to a value 69273656 or lower, sky Far Lands will not generate. Note that heightScale, like many other values in customized presets, is handled as a float, so at this point it's not possible to be any more precise than increments of eight.
