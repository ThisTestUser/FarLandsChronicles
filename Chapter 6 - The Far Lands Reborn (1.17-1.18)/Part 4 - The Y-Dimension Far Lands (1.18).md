In order to make the sky far lands appear, the Y-scale should be stretched to 196106.574487 (see Part 0). This allows the sky far lands to appear at Y=128. The sky far lands stop at Y=256, as that is the maximum height the terrain generator uses (features like trees will generate higher).

The vertex far lands are as expected (more chaotic than the corner far lands), and the sky edge far lands consist of a long continous stone slab running to Y=256, also as expected.

As we move into the farther lands, it seems that the terrain gets much smoother, as expected.

Now let's look at the void far lands (Y-Scale = 784426.297949). Below is how it looks without the aquifer fix.

The vertex far lands are as expected and can be thought of as the inversion of the sky vertex far lands.

As we move into the farther lands again, the terrain smooths out, mirroring the sky vertex farther lands.

Of course, the terrain can vary a lot, depending on the seed and axis.
