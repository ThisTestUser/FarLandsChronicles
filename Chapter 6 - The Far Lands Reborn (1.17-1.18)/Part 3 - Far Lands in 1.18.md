Now it's time to look at the far lands in 1.18.

Seed for all images: -4047588131989581834 (unless otherwise noted)

The first thing you'll notice when you teleport to the far lands is that it only extends up to 256 blocks.

Another thing you'll realize that after loading the world for a bit, the server side (terrain generation) stops responding, and new chunks are unable to load. This is caused by aquifers creating air pockets in the ocean.

To fix this, my mod forces aquifers to be always flooded (in 1.17, this only applies to terrain over 33 million blocks). Note that this does have the side effect of causing all air pockets below Y=64 to be flooded. All images below will be taken with the aquifer fix for 1.18.

Like 1.17, there is large variation in how the far lands generate. Some axises generate more terrain (stone) than others.

Above ground, the terrain in 1.18 is blocky, like 1.17. Here's the 1.17 seed (3192545518397860029), generated in 1.18. The biomes are different because the randomizer has changed.

In the farther lands, large variation is again observed.

Here's the terrain before the corner far lands transitions into the edge farther lands.
