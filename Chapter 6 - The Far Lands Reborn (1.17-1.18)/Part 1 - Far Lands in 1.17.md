With the exception of height changes (from raising the height limit) and composition changes (from adding new biomes), the far lands have remained mostly the same throughout previous versions. However, in 1.17 (with the Caves & Cliffs datapack), this all changes.

The far lands in 1.17 take full advantage of the height limit, stretching from 320 blocks to -64 blocks. The far lands also appear blocky, a lot like the distorted far lands seen in Cubic Chunks.

In the corner far lands, the blockiness of the far lands continues to be seen. Note the existence of cave carvers.

Below Y=64 though, aquifiers and the far lands terrain mix together, along with the occasional cave.

Because of the addition of local water levels, the terrain under sea level is no longer always flooded. Instead, water and lava aquifers dominate the land under Y=0, with a soild layer of lava below Y=-55, as lava replaces air at that point.

As we move into the farther lands, the terrain becomes flat and boring. All the images below show the terrain around the farther lands. Note that all the terrain below sea level is flooded because of the patch the mod applies.

This is what the corner far lands look like, 1 billon blocks out from spawn.

And here is the farther lands, which has all the varation removed.

Note that my far lands mod fixes an aquifer crash bug in the far lands, but in doing so, all air blocks under sea level are once again flooded.

Interestingly, the terrain below ground is almost entirely water (even before the farther lands start), with only a slab of deepslate in between.

This is a view of the terrain at (100 mill, 12550821) for comparision. Note how the far lands terrain extends all the way to bedrock for the edge far lands, but not the corner far lands. Also note how even the corner far lands extend down below Y=0, even though close to the farther lands, this is not the case.

It seems like at some point (about 67 million blocks), the far lands would stop generating underground. Note that the Y-coordinate scale wasn't messed with yet, so this is not caused by the void far lands.
