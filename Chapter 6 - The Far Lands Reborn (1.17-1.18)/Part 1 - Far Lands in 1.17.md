With the exception of height changes (from raising the height limit) and composition changes (from adding new biomes), the far lands have remained mostly the same throughout previous versions. However, in 1.17 (with the Caves & Cliffs datapack), this all changes.

The far lands in 1.17 take full advantage of the height limit, stretching from 320 blocks to -64 blocks. The far lands also appear blocky, a lot like the distorted far lands seen in Cubic Chunks.

In the corner far lands, the blockiness of the far lands continues to be seen. Note the existence of cave carvers.

Below Y=64 though, aquifers and the far lands terrain mix together, along with the occasional cave.

Because of the addition of local water levels, the terrain under sea level is no longer always flooded. Instead, water and lava aquifers are widespread underground, with a soild layer of lava below Y=-55, as lava replaces air at that point.

As we move into the farther lands, the terrain becomes flat and boring. All the images below show the terrain around the farther lands. Note that all the terrain below sea level is flooded because of the patch the far lands mod applies after 33 million blocks out, in order to fix an aquifer bug that causes an overflow error.

This is what the corner far lands look like, 1 billon blocks out from spawn, right before being replaced by the farther lands.

And here are the farther lands, with all its variation removed.

Note that there sometimes can be continuity between the edge and corner farther lands.

Interestingly, the terrain below ground is almost entirely water (even before the farther lands start), with only a slab of deepslate in between. All the holes in the terrain are the result of cave carvers. The pool of lava below still exists, but is covered by a soild wall of deepslate.

For other axises, this behavior is not shown, with the far lands terrain generating all the way to bedrock.

![17FartherOtherAxis2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch6/17FartherOtherAxis2.png)

Note that the slab of deepslate is caused by the mod's patch for aquifers.

Below is a view of the terrain at (100 mill, 12550821) for comparision. Note how the far lands terrain extends all the way to bedrock for the edge far lands, but not the corner far lands (this behavior is different for other axises). Also note how even the corner far lands extend down below Y=0, even though close to the farther lands, this is not the case.

Also, just for reference, here's the far lands if aquifers were completely filled with water (this is a patch needed for 1.18). The deepslate extends down to about Y=-30, with everything below being mostly ocean. There's a layer of deepslate covering the lava that is below Y=-55, like in the previous images.
