First, we will use 196106.574487 for the Y-scale (more details in Part 0). This allows for the sky far lands to appear at height 128. Like the other far lands, the terrain appears warped.

Here is the terrain right before the vertex far lands, the intersection of 3 different types of far lands.

Below is the corner far lands (before intersecting with the sky far lands).

And below is the vertex far lands. Because the terrain has been flattened, it is harder to tell the difference between the corner and vertex far lands, but it does look like that the terrain becomes more chaotic in the vertex far lands.

Like the vertex far lands in Cubic Chunks, there are many variations possible. For example, this variant of the vertex far lands is entirely soild terrain.

![17FarVertex2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch6/17FarVertex2.png)

In the vertex farther lands (Y above 128), the terrain can generate completely soild or empty.

![17FartherVertex2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch6/17FartherVertex2.png)

In another seed though, even more variations can be found. This is the same seed as the receding far lands shown in the 3D far lands chapter.
