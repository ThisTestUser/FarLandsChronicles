With the far lands re-enabled, the fartherer/est lands do not seem to exist at all (vanilla) or seems to exist as a "jump" in the terrain (Forge).

For example, here is X/Z = +4312430307758379832:

![FarLandsW1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch5/FarLandsW1.png)

(The terrain generates completely flat, and the holes are the result of sand falling.)

Here is the terrain at X=10004065811,Z=1004065811 (the X coordinate is at 10 billion, while the Z coordinate is at 1 billion)

![FarLandsW2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch5/FarLandsW2.png)

It seems that when trying to generate the fartherer lands (by modifying the coordinate scale) in Forge (with my 1.12.2 far lands mod), a "jump" in the terrain occurs.

The terrain then "drops" back at a further distance (note: different seed here)

![FarLandsDropBackForge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch5/FarLandsDropBackForge.png)

However, doing the exact same thing in vanilla (with the far lands re-enabled of course) results in the terrain being completely flat. This is the same seed as the image with the jump, 2666171903307131136):
