With the far lands re-enabled, the fartherer/est lands do not seem to exist at all (at least in vanilla).

For example, here is X/Z = +4312430307758379832:

![FarLandsW1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch5/FarLandsW1.png)

(The terrain generates completely flat, and the holes are the result of sand falling.)

Here is the terrain at X=10004065811,Z=1004065811 (the X coordinate is at 10 billion, while the Z coordinate is at 1 billion)

![FarLandsW2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch5/FarLandsW2.png)

It seems that getting these lands to generate while Cubic Chunks is installed (with far lands enabled) DOES result in a "jump" in terrain around this point (by increasing the coordinate scale).
