Normally, low and high noise will overflow at the exact same position as each other, give or take a single-digit number of blocks, meaning that it's generally been more convenient to think of both of them as one single noise generator. However, now that we have access to the terrain generation code, it's now entirely possible to decouple these nosie generators and make them function - and overflow - independently of each other. Let's see what happens if we do exactly that.

To start off with, let's multiply the x-coordinate of the noise generator straight after selector noise (see part 1) by 0.5D, and multiply the z-coordinate of the noise generator after that by 0.5D. This way, low noise will overflow at twice the normal distance on one axis, and high noise will overflow at twice the distance on the other, giving us more distinct regions of the Far Lands: one where low noise overflows on one axis but high noise does not, one where high noise overflows on one axis but low noise does not, and yet another axis where low noise overflows on one axis and high noise overflows on the other.
