Normally, low and high noise will overflow at the exact same position as each other, give or take a single-digit number of blocks, meaning that it's generally been more convenient to think of both of them as one single noise generator. However, now that we have access to the terrain generation code, it's now entirely possible to decouple these nosie generators and make them function - and overflow - independently of each other. Let's see what happens if we do exactly that.

To start off with, let's multiply the x-coordinate of the noise generator straight after selector noise (see part 1) by 0.5D, and multiply the z-coordinate of the noise generator after that by 0.5D. This way, low noise will overflow at twice the normal distance on one axis, and high noise will overflow at twice the distance on the other, giving us more distinct regions of the Far Lands: one where low noise overflows on one axis but high noise does not, one where high noise overflows on one axis but low noise does not, and yet another axis where low noise overflows on one axis and high noise overflows on the other.

With these changes made, let's check out the Corner Far Lands. Upon first inspection, they look the same, but flying up for an overhead view of what would usually be "The Stack" reveals that there's definitely something more unusual than normal going on here:

It seems as though that many directional artifacts characteristic of the Edge Far Lands are now manifesting in the corners as well.

If we inspect this scene a bit closer, we can also see what appears to be a small strip of completely normal-looking terrain in the corner, which isn't overwritten by overflowed noise immediately. Getting down to the ground level reveals this to be exactly what it is:

As it turns out, the edge Far Lands are full of many random pockets of normal-looking terrain. The reason for this is obvious: the areas of "normal terrain" correspond to the noise generator which has not overflowed, whereas Far Lands terrain is generated by the noise generator that has. Indeed, the patchy directional artifacts we see in the corner can be explained in the exact same way: the noise has overflowed in one direction, but not in the other.

If we now travel to twice the usual Far Lands distance, the "other" noise generator which has not yet overflowed will now overflow, giving way to reasonably typical Far Lands terrain. This is much easier to see in the corner than the edge. Note that directional artifacts of some sorts may still exist, as the noise generators are scaled by a factor in 2 on one axis of the xz plane, which is not the case in vanilla.

From the inside, the "corner" Far Lands where one side overflows but the other does not is incredibly chaotic, and generally does not lend itself to visually interesting terrain. Only once everything has overflowed can we encounter non-obtrusive terrain, which resembles the usual "Stack".

So far, the only things we've changed are low noise and high noise. By changing these, we've been able to note that they can operate independently, with some regions of terrain being affected by the overflow and others remaining the same. Indeed, the regions which are affected by low noise versus high noise are themselves controlled by a noise generator - namely the selector noise we discussed previously. If we make selector noise overflow before either low or high noise, the phenomena we saw resulting from selector noise still working normally should also somehow break. Let's set it to overflow by changing the two "80D" values shown for X and Z to "0.5D" to make it overflow at half the distance of low and high noise. We've already seen how selector noise looks when it overflows before the usual Far Lands in Part 1, so let's skip straight ahead to the Far Lands.

We can definitely see that the Far Lands still appear as usual, but they seem a bit blockier than we'd normally expect, with some tunnels being much wider than before:

![FLPreOverflowedCorner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muzikbike/FarLandsChronicles/patch-3/assets/Ch1/FLPreOverflowedCorner.png)

In some rare cases, we can even have the Far Lands differing in height depending on what axis we're on. Here's a very obvious example (seed 1, positive-positive corner):

![TallerOnOneSideHeadOn](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muzikbike/FarLandsChronicles/patch-3/assets/Ch1/TallerOnOneSideHeadOn.png)

We can even have cases where the direction of the lines differs depending on the Y-coordinate. In the following case, the Far Lands give way to a seething matrix of gridlike terrain stripes.

The number of possible interesting effects that can arise from manipulating the noise generators in this way are far too numerous to detail here.
