Normally, low and high noise will overflow at the exact same position as each other, give or take a single-digit number of blocks, meaning that it's generally been more convenient to think of both of them as one single noise generator. However, now that we have access to the terrain generation code, it's now entirely possible to decouple these nosie generators and make them function - and overflow - independently of each other. Let's see what happens if we do exactly that.

To start off with, let's multiply the x-coordinate of the noise generator straight after selector noise (see part 1) by 0.5D, and multiply the z-coordinate of the noise generator after that by 0.5D. This way, low noise will overflow at twice the normal distance on one axis, and high noise will overflow at twice the distance on the other, giving us more distinct regions of the Far Lands: one where low noise overflows on one axis but high noise does not, one where high noise overflows on one axis but low noise does not, and yet another axis where low noise overflows on one axis and high noise overflows on the other.

With these changes made, let's check out the Corner Far Lands. For the most part, they look the same, but flying up for an overhead view of what would usually be "The Stack" reveals that there's definitely something more unusual than normal going on here:

It seems as though that many directional artifacts characteristic of the Edge Far Lands are now manifesting in the corners as well.

If we inspect this scene a bit closer, we can also see what appears to be a small strip of completely normal-looking terrain in the corner, which isn't overwritten by overflowed noise immediately. Getting down to the ground level reveals this to be exactly what it is:

As it turns out, the edge Far Lands are full of many random pockets of normal-looking terrain. The reasoning for this is obvious: the areas of "normal terrain" correspond to the noise generator which has not overflowed, whereas Far Lands terrain is generated by the noise generator that has. Indeed, the patchy directional artifacts we see in the corner can be explained in the exact same way: the noise has overflowed in one direction, but not in the other.
