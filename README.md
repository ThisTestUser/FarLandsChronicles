# The Far Lands Chronicles

### What are the far lands?
The far lands are a term used to describe the land beyond X/Z += 12,550,821 in Minecraft before beta 1.8. At that point, a giant wall would stand between the normal terrain and the far lands.

### Why are they so fascinating?
The far lands may be gone in the Java edition, but their legacy lives on. Through mods, they can be revived, and sometimes, they can exist in places you would never expect them too.
