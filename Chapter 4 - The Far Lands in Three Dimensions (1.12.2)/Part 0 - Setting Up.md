In order to explore the far lands in the third dimension, we'll need the Cubic Chunks mod and Cubic World Gen mod, along with my far lands mod. Once you have those installed, enable the far lands by heading to cubicworldgen\_mixin\_config.json and changing allow\_farlands\_worldgen to true. Also change the default min and max heights in the Cubic Chunks config (cubicchunks.cfg).

Now, create a world with "Custom Cubic" as the type. Teleport up to (12550821, 25101642, 12550821), and you should see the vertex far lands. Remember that the sky far lands start at twice the limit where the edge far lands start.
