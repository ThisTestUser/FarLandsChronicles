The void far lands are the final frontier of the far lands. Normally, negative Y values do not generate terrain, but with Cubic Chunks, the world generates all the way down to the lower integer limit.

Here is the intersection of the 3 edges of the far lands, void version:

Here's the inverted version of the sky-edge far lands:

Now let's look at the vertex far lands. It doesn't seem too interesting at first, with the terrain being either completely solid or liquid.

However, floating islands can also be found.

The farther lands are generated below.

Here's the receding version of the void far lands. We saw this for the sky far lands also.

And here's a distorted version:

Below is the only time I saw the vertex farther lands generate.

Normally, though, the vertex farther lands are relatively uninteresting:
