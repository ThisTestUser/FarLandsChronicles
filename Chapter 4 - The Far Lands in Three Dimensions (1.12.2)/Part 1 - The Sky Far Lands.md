The vertex far lands hold some of the most spectacular terrain Minecraft has ever seen. Here we'll be exploring the sky far lands.

We'll start with the intersection where the sky far lands begin.

Here, we see the area where the sky far lands and the edge far lands meet. Here, we see a series of walls that extend upwards.

The vertex far lands are pictured below.

However, for this corner, as we move in, the terrain turns entirely solid.

This is just one corner. There are so many variations here it is just impossible to show them all.

Below are examples of the farther lands.

Here's a picture of the "receding" far lands.

Here's a distorted version of the farther lands generating (Seed: -4095175192329492247):

And here is the vertex farther lands. This is the only example I've found that doesn't generate either solid or empty.

This is an example of the vertex farther lands generating a cube of stone.
