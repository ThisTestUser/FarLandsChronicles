The vertex far lands hold some of the most spectacular terrain Minecraft has ever seen. Here we'll be exploring the sky far lands, as well as the farther lands and all its variations.

Seed: -936504578442456880 (unless otherwise noted)

We'll start with the intersection where the sky far lands begin.

The sky far lands are depicted below, which look similar to the edge far lands.

Below is the area where the sky far lands and the edge far lands meet. This manifests as a series of walls that extend upwards.

The vertex far lands are pictured below. We'll consider this the normal type of terrain that generates here.

However, for this corner, as we move in, the terrain begins to become more blocky. From the images below, we can see that the transition is gradual.

Eventually, a hard boundary appears, as the generation switches to generating stone everywhere.

We have already seen 3 different variations of the vertex far lands terrain, from one corner of one seed. The last variation, shown below, results in nothing being generated.

Let's look more into the transitions between the variations. They only occur between solid and blocky or empty and blocky, and can be parallel to one axis or to none. They never affect the terrain before the vertex far lands.

The follow two images are from the same seed (-7852708077945345001), but on different corners. They suggest a symmetry between the transitions.

Blocky terrain serves as an intermediate state, and is required to be present on a side of any transition boundary. It is possible for the vertex far lands to start off with blocky terrain.

Now let's look at the farther lands. We'll focus on the selector noise overflowing in one or two axises for now, leaving the vertex farther lands for the final part of this chapter.

The four terrain variations are still distinguishable in the farther lands. Below are images of the normal farther lands, with terrain generating as expected.

Here's a distorted version of the farther lands generating. Note that the distortion continues into the farther lands. (Seed: -4095175192329492247)

The last two variations are uninteresting, as the solid or empty terrain extends across the boundary and no differences appear when crossing into the farther lands.

Transitions between the types of terrains continue into the farther lands. Like before, they can be parallel to an axis or to none.

![SFartherT5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch4/SFartherT5.png)

It is important to remember that transitions only happen within the vertex far lands area, when the low noise and high noise overflow on all 3 axises.
