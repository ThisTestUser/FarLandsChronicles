Our journey starts off in 1.16.5, with the Abyss II mod. The first dimension we will visit is the frost world biome.

![AbyssII3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/AbyssII3.png)

Because the terrain generation generates all the way to the height limit, there's no room for vegetation.

The next dimension to visit is the Ground Lands.

Now, onto the main Abyss dimension. This one has the most vegetation, as it is the primary dimension of this mod.

The next destination is a merger of three mods: The Endergetic Expansion, Better End (Forge), and the Outer End. Since the End far lands generate up to 128 blocks, lots of structures can be found on top of them.

![EndFar1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/EndFar1.png)

Sometimes, the surface features are able to generate normally, even in the edge far lands.

![EndFar2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/EndFar2.png)

In the corner far lands, the terrain looks almost the same as it would look normally from above.

![EndFar3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/EndFar3.png)

![EndFar4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/EndFar4.png)

Even in the edge far lands, the surface features still work well with the terrain.

![EndFar5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/EndFar5.png)

![EndFar6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/EndFar6.png)

Below the first layer of terrain, no large trees generate, but that doesn't prevent smaller features from generating.

![EndFar7](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/EndFar7.png)

The farther lands are affected by a glitch in the end dimension, which prevents the terrain from being generated properly.

![EndFar8](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/EndFar8.png)

![EndFar9](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/EndFar9.png)

Now let's move on to the Blue Skies mod in 1.18.1. The far lands do not generate here, but there is an interesting far lands-like bug in the cave generation, which causes the caves to be stretched out in the same way that tunnels in the far lands generate.

![BlueSkies1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/BlueSkies1.png)

![BlueSkies2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/BlueSkies2.png)

![BlueSkies3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/BlueSkies3.png)

![BlueSkies4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/BlueSkies4.png)

The cave distortions start when the X and Z coords exceed 2^24 (16,777,216). At that point, a slight distortion of the terrain can be seen, which gets worse every power of 2.

![BlueSkies5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/BlueSkies5.png)

The next set of mods we'll be looking at are from Stardust Labs. Below are images from the Terralith 1.0 mod, which adds a bunch of new biomes and intergrates Caves and Cliffs features.

![Terralith1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/Terralith1.png)

![Terralith2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/Terralith2.png)

![Terralith3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/Terralith3.png)

Below ground, cave biomes generate as well, but cave features are rarer than normal.

![Terralith4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/Terralith4.png)

Below are two images of Terralith biomes generating in the edge far lands.

![Terralith5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/Terralith5.png)

![Terralith6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/Terralith6.png)

In the farther lands, "mountains" are able to generate, because the top grass block is between Y=280 to 290, rather than at Y=320 earlier.

![Terralith7](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/Terralith7.png)

Large cave features also generate in the farther lands.

![Terralith8](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/Terralith8.png)

Because the terrain does not go up to the height limit, trees are able to generate abundantly.

![Terralith9](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/Terralith9.png)

Interestingly, some biomes are able to generate trees underground. Here is an example of this happening in the yellowstone biome.

![Terralith10](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/Terralith10.png)

Now, let's head to the Nether to see the far lands with Incendium.

![Incendium1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/Incendium1.png)

![Incendium2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/Incendium2.png)

The corner far lands are not very different from normal nether generation, and not many differences can be found there. Within the edge far lands, the biomes warps itself to match the terrain shape.

![Incendium3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/Incendium3.png)

The same thing can be seen in the farther lands, except that the corner farther lands are all flat.

![Incendium4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/Incendium4.png)

![Incendium5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/Incendium5.png)

Let's now head to 1.18.1, to look at the terrain generated by Terralith 2.0. Note that the aquifer bug still exists, so the aquifer fix will have to be applied.

![TerralithII1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/TerralithII1.png)

The terrain does not stop at Y=256, nor does it stop at Y=320; Instead, it stops somewhere between those two numbers, and that somewhere can vary. Some of that variation may be due to the biomes themselves, as seen in the picture below. The biome shown is the highlands biome, which generates elevated terrain.

![TerralithII2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/TerralithII2.png)

The far lands eliminates all variations in terrain, even with Terralith biomes that are supposed to generate differently. The below biome is the volcano biome, which is supposed to generate volcano-like terrain.

![TerralithII3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/TerralithII3.png)

Despite this, surface features still work with the terrain generation. Depicted below is the sandstone valley biome, which because of the falling sand crashes after a while.

![TerralithII4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/TerralithII4.png)

Below are the edge farther lands.

![TerralithII5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/TerralithII5.png)

Sometimes, the biome generation causes the far lands to generate more sparsely than normal. The first image below shows the white cliffs biome generating in the edge far lands, and the second shows the shield biome in the edge farther lands.

![TerralithII6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/TerralithII6.png)

![TerralithII7](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/TerralithII7.png)

In order to view the Terralith cave biomes, the aquifer fix has to be disabled, which allows the cave biomes to generate within the far lands until aquifers completely break (beyond the world border).

![TerralithII8](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/TerralithII8.png)

Because the terrain below is still partially flooded, it is very difficult for the cave features to generate. However, the cave features can sometimes generate above sea level.

![TerralithII9](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/TerralithII9.png)

Even when under sea level, the cave features can still generate. The coordinates below are 13 million, 13 million.

![TerralithII10](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/TerralithII10.png)

However, some aquifers don't generate with air pockets. When this happens, the cave is entirely submerged. Below is an image of a submerged cave (the image was taken inside a block, which removes the water overlay).

![TerralithII11](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisTestUser/FarLandsChronicles/master/assets/Ch7/TerralithII11.png)
